# MoneyBot v0.0.808000001 - Green Pumpkin
Discord bot made entirely with ChatGPT and Deepseek, there will be no support provided

I don't think i've typed a single line of code in myself

## Requirements
- Python venv with all the stuff in requirements.txt (there is most likely things missing but I don't want to fix that)
- discord.py
- mongodb server
- `.env`(refer to the .env.example)
- ollama instance running dolphin-mistral or just change it yourself
- [zipline](https://zipline.diced.sh/)

## TODO
- Implement Docker
- Fix start.sh (Get rid of absolute paths or change it)
- Fix hardcoded user id in some of the commands
- Profile picture rotation (seems to only rotate between 5 pictures max)
